					<h4>User Interviews</h4>
					<p>User interviews attempts to understand user needs and behaviors through questions and other feedback methodologies. It is an effective way to understand what users are looking for in a product. I interviewed three possible users of my personal portfolio website, asking questions related to lifestyle, interest, expectation, concerns, etc. I tried to formulate open-end questions in order to give interviewees a lot of freedom in their answers. This produces more honest and reliable answers.</p>

					<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
					<p>Competitor analysis identifies and evaluates the application's competitors. Competitors can be either direct or indirect. For an example, another student's personal portfolio site would be a direct competitor. On the other hand, a site like WordPress or any other website builder would be an indirect competitor. I analyzied 6 competitors, writing about their notable features, strengths, weaknesses, etc. By reviewing these competitors, I learned what I need to compete in the market and make my site more appealing.</p>

					<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
					<p>Feature value matrix ranks the features according to user value, business value, and development effort. Using this rank, developers can prioritize which features to implement first in the development process. I selected these features after analyzing user interviews and competitor analysis. I thought these features would make my personal portfolio site carry out its goal. Some of these features include contact information, resume, biography, photo, etc.</p>

					<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
					<p>Feature prioritization selects specific features to be implemented first. This make the development process efficient by prioritizing features that are important and relatively easier to implement. Features that have high user and business value and require low technical effort are prioritized first. In my project, such features include contact information, resume, picture, navigation, etc. Features that have low user and business value and require high technical effort are prioritized last. In my project, such features include hit (visit) counter, etc.</p>

					<h4>User Stories</h4>
					<p>User stories capture description of features in the perspective of the users. By creating "stories," it is easier to visualize and understand what the user would want as they use the site. I created my user stories based on my feature list, expanding each feature to one or more use cases (or "stories"). By creating these user stories, I was able to think in terms of the users and really understand what they want. For example, I created many user stories in the perspective of a hiring manager. This allowed me to catch and fix certain problems that arised in my site.</p>

					<h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
					<p>Cognitive walkthrough is a study where user is asked to perform a specifed series of tasks while the tester carefully takes note of the user's behavior. Cognitive walkthrough is used to understand the site's learnability for users. Cognitive walkthroughs can reveal parts that are too complicated or confusing. One challenge I faced while conducting cognitive walkthrough was taking sufficient notes down during the interivew. 
					Since it is important to take note of small behaviors, it was a challenge to note all those down in a short amount of time.</p>

					<h4>User Test</h4>
					<p>I conducted four user tests -- five second test, navigation test, question test, and click test. I chose five second test to figure out first impression of my site. Participants overall liked my site but some said the deisgn was slightly plain. I chose navigation test to make sure the navigation of the site functions properly. I chose question test to ask specific questions about my site. I received suggestions that note the plainess of the site. I chose click test to make sure users are clicking the right location.</p>

			<h3 class="text-center"><b>Summary of Findings</b></h1>	
			<br>
			<div class="row justify-content-center">
				<div class="col-8">
					When I first heard that I was creating a personal portfolio site, I thought I had a good idea how to implement it and what to include in it. However, conducting user research made me realize that I did not know a lot of things that users were looking for in my site. After user research, I was able to view my site in the perspective of different end-users such as hiring manager, colleague, professor, etc. Also, I was able to correctly prioritize my features through feature selection and prioritization. Prior to this, I did not expect a feature like contact information would be one of my highest prioritized features. However, it makes sense because contact information is easy to implement yet provides much user and business value. One of the biggest problems I faced while conducting user research is the lack of variety in interviewees. I only researched with students. I wished I had done it with people of other positions such as hiring managers or recruiters to get their point of views.<br><br>
					After user research, I implemented my personal portfolio site according to the feature prioritization. I followed by conducting user tests and was able to found many important flaws and issues with my site. User tests were very useful because I tested my site with actual end users. I received many valuable insights. For an example, many testers said that my site looked relatively plain and can possibly be boring. My intention during development was to purposely pursuit a minimalistic design. However, this approach seemed to make my site look little boring. I learned that even when looking at a same site with same interface, many different opinions and views can rise. This made me think about how I should implement and update my interface accordingly to satisfy needs to various types of end users.<br><br>
					The biggest challenge I faced while conducting my user research and tests are recruiting particpants. I initially planned to recruit participants of various professions, such as student, hiring manager, recruiter, professor, etc. However, I was only able to recruit students to participate in my test. While they provided valuable insights, it would have been beneficial to have insights from people of different backgrounds.

			<h3 class="text-center"><b>Incorporation of Findings</b></h1>	
			<br>
			<div class="row justify-content-center">
				<div class="col-8">
					One common sugggestion I received through user tests was that my site looked plain. Before I started developing my site, I wanted my site to be like this -- I wanted to build a simple and minimalistic site. After receiving feedback that my site is too plain, however, I tried to add more fun to it. I wanted to add more interactive fun to my site while keeping its simple and minimalistic design. To do that, I added more animations to titles, content, and sections. For an example, I used an external JavaScript library to reveal the content as the user scrolls down the page. While this does not have an obvious effect, I thought it would be a good place to start.<br><br>
					Another finding was that certain parts of my site was difficult to find at a glance. While I was conducting user test, I created user stories in the perspectives of a hiring manager. As I created and studied my user studies, I realized that my skills are rather difficult to find quickly. My skills were just embedded into my biography, so users would have to read my biography to learn about my skills. This caused my skills to be difficult to find. To incorporate this finding, I made a separate skills list in the "About" section of my site, so that the users can easily find my skills at a glance.<br><br>
					For the future, I plan to continue upgrade and develop my site. One specific thing I want to do is to make it more fun. While I added some new elements to achieve this, I think there is a lot more room for improvement. I hope my end users can have a little bit of fun and excitement as they browse my site, so I definitely want to work on this part.
